# Ticket Booking System



## System architecture
Certainly! Let's create a high-level system design for your Ticket Booking System. Keep in mind that this is an abstract overview, and you can further refine and expand upon it based on your specific requirements and architecture.
Ticket Booking System: High-Level System DesignComponents:- User Interface (UI):
    - Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
    - Includes features like sign-up, login, search, booking, and cancellation.
- Backend Services:
    - Responsible for processing user requests and managing data.
    - Key components:
        - Authentication Service: Handles user authentication and authorization.
        - Booking Service: Manages ticket reservations and cancellations.
        - Train Service: Provides train-related information (schedules, availability, fares).
        - User Service: Manages user profiles and bookings.
- Database:
    - Stores essential data:
        - User profiles
        - Train schedules
        - Bookings
- External APIs:
    - Integrates with external services (e.g., payment gateways, real-time train data providers).
Workflow:- User Registration and Authentication:
    - Users sign up with their credentials (username, password).
    - The authentication service verifies user identity.
- Search and Booking:
    - Users search for trains based on source and destination.
    - The train service provides relevant train information.
    - Users select a train and book seats.
    - The booking service records the reservation.
- Ticket Cancellation:
    - Users can cancel their bookings.
    - The booking service updates the database accordingly.
- Real-Time Updates:
    - The system periodically fetches real-time train data (e.g., delays, availability).
    - Users receive notifications about changes.
Scalability Considerations:- Load Balancing: Distribute user requests across multiple backend instances.
- Caching: Cache frequently accessed data (train schedules, user profiles) to reduce database load.
- Horizontal Scaling: Add more servers as user traffic increases.
Security Measures:- Encryption: Secure communication between UI and backend using HTTPS.
- Authorization: Ensure users can only access their own bookings.
- Input Validation: Validate user inputs to prevent malicious data.
Remember, this high-level design serves as a starting point. You can delve deeper into each component, define APIs, choose technologies, and consider deployment strategies based on your project's needs. Happy coding! üöÄüéüÔ∏è
